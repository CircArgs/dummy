I'll walk you through setting up SSH and SSHFS in a container with minimal authentication for local access. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Dockerfile Configuration:
```dockerfile
# Install SSH
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openssh-server

# Configure SSH for passwordless, key-less access
RUN mkdir -p /var/run/sshd
RUN sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
RUN sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
RUN sed -i 's/#PermitEmptyPasswords no/PermitEmptyPasswords yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
RUN sed -i 's/#Port 22/Port 22/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Ensure correct permissions
RUN chmod 755 /var/run/sshd

# Expose SSH port
EXPOSE 22

# Startup command
CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]
```

2. Kubernetes/Container Configuration:
```yaml
containers:
- name: your-container
  ports:
  - containerPort: 22
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000  # appuser
  volumeMounts:
  - name: workspace
    mountPath: /workspace
```

3. On Your Mac, SSH Configuration:
```bash
# Ensure SSH is installed (usually pre-installed on Mac)
# If not, install via Homebrew
brew install openssh

# Generate an SSH config for easy connection
# ~/.ssh/config
Host container-ssh
    HostName <container-ip-or-hostname>
    User appuser
    Port 22
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
```

4. Connecting via SSH:
```bash
# Direct SSH connection
ssh container-ssh

# SSHFS Mount
sshfs container-ssh:/workspace /local/mountpoint
```

Key Considerations:
- This is ONLY for fully trusted, internal environments
- Completely removes authentication barriers
- Relies on network-level security
- Appropriate for development/testing scenarios

Verification Steps:
```bash
# Verify SSH service is running in container
ps aux | grep sshd

# Check port exposure
netstat -tuln | grep :22
```

Potential Adjustments:
- Ensure container network policies restrict external access
- Use Kubernetes network policies to control traffic
- Limit to specific trusted networks

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps or explain the security implications?
